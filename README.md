This is a custom time and expense reporting application.  Employees can record credit card expenses and report time.  

I built it as a learning experience, but it has turned into a useful tool for the organization it was built for.  Most of it was built from scratch, including authentication, authorization, responsive CSS, and printable views.  

Some AJAX and JavaScript have been added to improve the user experience. All records can be exported to CSV for backup.  

`bundle install`

`bundle exec rake db:migrate`

`bundle exec rake db:seed`
